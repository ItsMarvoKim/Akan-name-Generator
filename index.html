                <p class="crptn1">Akan names are derived from Ghananian culture. In Ghana, the method in which children are named is by their first name being a 'day name' which corresponds to the day of the week in which they were born. Middle names however, have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name. <br>This web application registers a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week in which they were born and based on their gender generates their Akan Name.</p>
                <p class="crptn1">Below is a list of some Ghananian Names based on the day of birth:</p>
